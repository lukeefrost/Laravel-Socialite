## Laravel Socialite

Project created utilising socialite which enables registration and login for the application using the Laravel framework. Note: For some reason the login and registration page doesn't show the correct layout when displayed. This is something I've been unable to fix. I also added functionality to attempt to log in/register using twitter. However because I have an exisiting twitter app created and it won't let me create another, it won't let me create another one therefore not allowing me to sort the authenticaion for this part. I have left placeholder code in services.php which require details for client id and client secret. The way the project is set up can also apply for additional authentication for facebook, github, google and linkedin.
